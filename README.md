# Caps
Caps_2.RMD was created on a Windows 8.1 laptop with 2.75G available RAM.
To work around the memory issues, all source data was unloaded/unzipped and saved as text files.
If you wish to download and rebuild .RMD, it will save time and space to set eval=FALSE after down loading the
source data once and, cache = TRUE for subsequent builds after the first completes.
